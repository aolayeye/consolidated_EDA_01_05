## Analysis 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (Descriptive Analysis)
#### Five – Number Summary
Our EDA focused on comparing residential and commercial property transactions across various neighborhoods and boroughs, emphasizing Richmond Hill in Queens. The analysis revealed that residential transactions involving smaller properties were more common across all areas. However, commercial transactions, while less frequent, had the potential for larger property sizes in particular regions, such as Jamaica in Queens. (Figure 1)
Richmond Hill typically features smaller properties in terms of Gross Square Feet (GSF), translating to lower sale prices compared to neighborhoods with larger properties. Nonetheless, differences are apparent across boroughs, with Manhattan featuring significantly larger properties and higher sale prices. (Figure 2) A clear correlation between Gross Square Feet and Sale Price emerged, pointing to the fact that larger properties command higher prices. This finding is important, as areas with higher prices could present profitable opportunities due to their direct impact on revenue potential and an indication of market activity.

#### Total Sales by Property Type – Boroughs, Neighborhoods
Borough-wise, Manhattan led in total sales for commercial and residential properties, followed by Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. However, in Queens, residential sales significantly exceeded commercial sales, suggesting a predominantly residential real estate market, a trend observed across other boroughs except for Manhattan.
Neighborhood-wise, Richmond Hill registered the highest total residential sales in Queens and showed significant commercial and mixed property sales, indicating a diverse real estate market. Although other neighborhoods like Forest Hills and South Jamaica also had high residential sales, their commercial and mixed property sales were lower. Jamaica stood out with high sales across all property types. (Figure 3)

#### Sales Distribution in 2021 – NYC, Queens, Richmond Hill
For NYC and Queens, sales transactions peaked in August and were lowest in December, revealing a seasonal pattern. (Figure 4) However, Richmond Hill showed a more consistent sales distribution across the months. The neighborhood saw smaller peaks in June and August but maintained a steady transaction rate throughout the year. (Figure 5)
In conclusion, while NYC and Queens show a clear seasonality pattern in sales volume, Richmond Hill demonstrates less seasonality, maintaining consistent transactions throughout the year. Richmond Hill's steady sales and alignment with broader Queens and NYC market trends make it a potential candidate for a new real estate office. However, other variables, such as local market conditions, property prices, and competitive landscape, must be considered before making the final decision.

#### Sales Transaction Expected Growth Rate
NYC and Queens witnessed significant growth in transaction numbers from 2017 to 2021, despite a downturn in 2020, likely due to the pandemic. Specifically, NYC transactions increased from 27,270 to 60,537, while Queens grew from 10,623 to 17,133. (Figure 6) Contrastingly, Richmond Hill maintained stable transaction numbers ranging between 307 and 438 during this period, despite experiencing a downturn in 2020 and a slight recovery in 2021.

In conclusion, while NYC and Queens showed substantial growth in sales transactions, Richmond Hill demonstrated resilience and stability. Hence, Richmond Hill presents potential as a suitable neighborhood for a new real estate office, given its steady performance and alignment with the Queens and NYC market trends. However, considerations of local demand, supply conditions, property prices, and market competition remain crucial in making a final decision. (Figure 7)

#### Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
Among all boroughs, Brooklyn exhibited the highest CAGR at 6.73%, while Manhattan showed a negative growth rate of -3.34%. The Queens borough displayed moderate growth at 4.96%. Within Queens, Jamaica had the highest neighborhood CAGR at 5.44%, while Forest Hills experienced the lowest growth at 0.82%. Applying the CAGR to predict the expected number of transactions for 2022, Queens could have approximately 23,338 transactions, and Richmond Hill around 400. Despite its low growth rate, Forest Hills emerged as a high-value neighborhood, with the largest maximum gross square feet and a high maximum sale price among the examined Queens neighborhoods. (Figure 8)
In conclusion, Richmond Hill shows robust growth, aligning closely with the broader Queens borough growth trend, indicating it could be a suitable neighborhood for a new real estate office. However, these predictions are based on past trends and must be evaluated alongside factors like local demand, supply conditions, property prices, and market competition, as future market conditions may vary.

#### Total Revenue
This analysis examined total revenue for 2021, calculated based on a 5% commission on residential sales and 12.5% market penetration. Borough-wise, Manhattan leads with over $268 million in revenue, attributed to its high-value real estate market. Brooklyn follows with approximately $125 million, while Queens ranks third, generating around $90 million. These numbers indicate lower property prices in Queens despite significant transactions. Staten Island and the Bronx have about $25 million in comparable revenues, considerably lower than the other boroughs. Forest Hills generates the highest revenue among Queens' neighborhoods, over $3 million, consistent with earlier analyses indicating larger, high-end properties. Richmond Hill is the second-highest revenue earner, with around $1.7 million, reflecting its strong real estate market. In contrast, Jamaica Bay has the lowest revenue of about $50k, suggesting fewer transactions, lower-priced properties, or both. (Figure 9)

Comparing these revenue figures with sales trends observed in previous analyses, higher sales volume does not necessarily translate into higher revenue, particularly in areas where property prices are lower. The revenue aligns more closely with the property prices in the areas than the number of transactions. The standout point here is the significant disparity in revenue between boroughs and neighborhoods. It's interesting to see how the property prices and market activity in each borough or neighborhood directly affect the revenue generated. Such insights can be crucial for real estate companies when planning strategies or deciding where to open new offices.

## Analysis 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (Descriptive Analysis)
#### Line Plots: Comparing Richmond Hill with Other Neighborhoods
The average price per square foot trend in Richmond Hill shows a consistent increase from 2003 to 2021. Despite experiencing a slight dip from 2008 to 2012, likely due to the global financial crisis, it shows a stable recovery and growth from 2012 onwards, demonstrating resilience in the real estate market. (Figure 5) (Figure 8)

Compared to other neighborhoods, Richmond Hill is less volatile. When the average price per square foot in different neighborhoods, like Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, and South Ozone Park, shows significant fluctuations, Richmond Hill tends to maintain a steadier trend. This trend means that while Richmond Hill may not have the highest average sale price per square foot, it also doesn't have the lowest values. (Figure 1) (Figure 2) (Figure 3) (Figure 6)
Other neighborhoods, like South Ozone Park and Kew Gardens, are more volatile than Richmond Hill. They have experienced more significant fluctuations, especially in response to external factors like the 2008 financial crisis. On the other hand, Richmond Hill has shown more consistency, with gradual and steady growth, particularly since 2012. (Figure 2) (Figure 3)

Richmond Hill's average price per square foot is generally lower than the larger Queens average. However, the growth rate in Richmond Hill is like that of Queens, suggesting that while properties in Richmond Hill may be less expensive, they offer comparable growth potential. (Figure 11)
The similarities and differences between Richmond Hill and other neighborhoods indicate potential opportunities for a new real estate brokerage office.
Despite its lower average price per square foot, Richmond Hill's consistency and resilience could be advantageous. It may appeal to many clients, from those seeking more affordable properties to those looking for steady real estate growth. (Figure 4) (Figure 7) (Figure 9) Based on the data and analysis, Richmond Hill may be a good location for a new real estate brokerage office. The stable and consistent average price per square foot growth makes it an attractive location. Furthermore, compared to the larger Queens area, it offers similar growth potential but at a generally lower price point, which could appeal to various clients.

#### Summary Statistics: Comparing Richmond Hill with other Neighborhoods.
Compared to other neighborhoods in Queens, the summary statistics provide additional insights into Richmond Hill.
Minimum and Maximum: The average price per square foot in Richmond Hill varies from $196.74 to $436.24. These figures suggest that Richmond Hill has experienced significant growth but still has lower prices than Forest Hills and Jamaica Estates. The minimum sale price is higher than in specific areas such as Jamaica, South Jamaica, and Jamaica Bay.

Median: Richmond Hill's median average price per square foot is $277.38, which is lower than the larger QUEENS median of $310.38. These values imply that properties in Richmond Hill are typically more affordable than the borough average. (Figure 12)

Standard Deviation: Richmond Hill's standard deviation is $72.12, lower than the borough average of $91.41. Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, and Jamaica Estates have higher standard deviations, indicating more price volatility. These values suggest that price fluctuations in Richmond Hill are less volatile than in Queens. (Figure 12)

Mean: Richmond Hill's mean (average price per square foot) is $285.52, less than the QUEENS mean of $335.81. We expect these mean values since QUEENS includes more affluent neighborhoods that raise the average. However, it also indicates that properties in Richmond Hill are generally more affordable, which could benefit a real estate brokerage.

Considering the above information, Richmond Hill is a promising new real estate brokerage office location. Its lower volatility suggests stability and less risk for potential investors. It also offers a range of properties with generally more affordable prices than the Queens average, which may attract a wider variety of clients. The consistent growth in property prices indicates a healthy market, providing a favorable environment for real estate businesses to succeed.

## Analysis 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (Descriptive and Diagnostic Analysis)
#### Five–Number Summary: Residential Sale Price and Gross Square Feet
We analyzed the Residential Sale Prices and Residential Gross Square Feet of Richmond Hill since 2009 and compared them with other neighborhoods in Queens using five-number summaries. This analysis picks up where our previous analysis ends, covering market trends, growth rates, sales distributions, and correlations between property size and sale value. The Gross Square Footage data analysis shows that Richmond Hill properties range from a minimum of 504 sqft to a maximum of 60,000 sqft. The median residential gross square footage of Richmond Hill is 1,616 sqft, indicating that properties in Richmond Hill are slightly smaller than those in Jamaica, Jamaica Estates, and Kew Gardens. (Figure 1)

The analysis of Residential Sale Prices reveals that the prices in Richmond Hill vary from $10,000 to $10,000,000, with a median price of $475,000. The price range is lower than Jamaica Estates and Forest Hills but higher than South Jamaica and Jamaica Bay. The analysis also highlights that Richmond Hill's lower quartile sale price is relatively higher than that of South Jamaica and Jamaica Bay, reinforcing the affordability advantage we identified in Analysis 2.
These insights confirm that Richmond Hill is an affordable, stable, and consistently growing real estate market, appealing to homebuyers seeking affordability and investors looking for potential growth opportunities. (Figure 2)

In conclusion, the analysis of the five-number summary on Residential Sale Prices and Gross Square Feet from 2009 to 2021 reaffirms Richmond Hill's status as an attractive real estate market. It offers a combination of affordability and growth potential, attracting a broad spectrum of homebuyers and investors. For a more detailed understanding of the market conditions, further analysis will focus on property type proportions, mean and standard deviations of Residential Sales Prices and Gross Square Feet, property type proportions, and transaction counts.

#### Descriptive Statistics: Proportions, Means, Standard Deviation, and Transaction Count.
This analysis includes a comprehensive KPI set covering various aspects of the real estate market, such as property type proportions, transaction counts, residential sale price average and standard deviation, gross square feet, correlation, and coefficient of variation (CV) since 2009. Richmond Hill is a dynamic real estate market with a high transaction count of 5,451, predominantly residential properties (0.89). Its mean residential sale price is approximately $504,549, which is lower than the overall Queens' mean of $704,176, highlighting its affordability advantage. Additionally, the standard deviation of the residential sale price in Richmond Hill is relatively lower, indicating a less volatile market than in other neighborhoods. The mean residential gross square footage in Richmond Hill is 1830 sqft, smaller than some neighborhoods but not far from the overall Queens with a mean of 2415 sqft. As expected, Richmond Hill has a strong correlation (0.71) between residential sale prices and gross square feet, implying that property size significantly influences sale prices. (Figure 3)

These insights could help understand future cluster analysis, potentially grouping Richmond Hill with neighborhoods that demonstrate similar patterns. The transaction count, property type proportions, average sale price, and correlation between price and size could all be defining factors for such clustering. In conclusion, Richmond Hill's real estate market is predominantly residential, dynamic, and affordable. Its properties show a strong correlation between size and price, making it an attractive prospect for investors and homebuyers. These findings are consistent with our previous analyses, further underpinning Richmond Hill's potential as a viable real estate office expansion location.

#### Cluster Analysis: Data Preparation and KPIs
We conducted a thorough cluster analysis of 256 neighborhoods across the five boroughs of New York City. The process included data preparation, selecting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), scaling the data, and treating outliers. To ensure relevance, we filtered the real estate transactions to include only those with a sale price of at least $10,000 and properties larger than 300 square feet from 2009 onwards. We selected three KPIs: median sale price, number of sales, and price per sqft, based on their variance and correlation analyses, providing unique and relevant clustering information. These KPIs allowed us to segment neighborhoods meaningfully for insight generation. (Figure 4)

To achieve accurate and meaningful results, we scaled the data to ensure all KPIs were on a similar scale, and we analyzed six outlier rows across the three KPIs. We judged their impact on the overall analysis to be minimal and kept them in the data. In the next step, we determined the appropriate number of clusters using the Elbow method and performed k-mean clustering on the scaled data. It is important to note that although the chosen KPIs and the presence of outliers influence the insights from the cluster analysis, the insights derived present a valuable starting point for further exploration and analysis. (Figure 5)

#### Cluster Analysis: Visualizing the Clusters
Using a scatter plot matrix, we could visualize the clusters and understand the relationships between our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): median sale price, number of sales, and price per square foot. The scatter plot matrix highlighted a clear distinction between the two types of neighborhoods. The red cluster represented neighborhoods with a broader range of median sale prices and a positive correlation between the number of sales and median sale price. The blue cluster, in contrast, showed more uniform median sale prices and a weaker correlation between the number of sales transactions and median sale price.

The correlation matrix provided further insights. A negative correlation (-0.352) between the median sale price and the number of sales suggested that more expensive neighborhoods tend to have fewer sales. Conversely, a strong positive correlation (0.815) between the median sale price and the price per square foot indicated that neighborhoods with higher prices also tend to have a higher price per square foot. An inverse relationship was seen between the number of sales and the price per square foot (-0.311), suggesting that neighborhoods with more sales tend to be more affordable. (Figure 6)
Upon examining the clusters, Richmond Hill and other neighborhoods of interest were found in Cluster 2 (the blue cluster). This segmentation suggests that these neighborhoods have a more uniform median sale price and a weaker correlation between the number of sales and median sale price, reflecting a more stable and predictable real estate market.

Given the nature of the blue cluster, Richmond Hill may be a suitable location for a new real estate brokerage office. The uniform price range and weaker correlation between the number of sales and price indicate a potentially stable and predictable market that could appeal to a brokerage, as it may offer more predictable commissions and be less susceptible to large market fluctuations. (Figure 7) (Figure 8)

In conclusion, the EDA revealed two distinct clusters in the New York City real estate market, each with unique characteristics and trends. The neighborhood of Richmond Hill falls within a segment that might be advantageous for a new real estate brokerage office due to its more stable and predictable real estate market. It is important to note where k =3, Cluster 3 (Richmond Hill and other neighborhoods) showed a weak positive relationship between the number of sales and the price per square foot. This is not ideal, considering the strong correlation we previously found between the sale price and gross square footage. In the next step, we will supplement these findings by comparing prices across neighborhoods using the Welch Two sample t-test.


#### Hypothesis Test – Comparing Residential Sale Prices
Our analysis examined the average prices of residential properties in different neighborhoods. We used t-tests to determine if there were any significant differences in the mean property prices between Richmond Hill and the other neighborhoods. Here are the key insights we gained from our t-test analysis:
There is a significant difference in the mean property prices between Richmond Hill and Jamaica, Jamaica Hills and Jamaica Estates. Richmond Hill has lower mean property prices, and the p-values confirm the statistical significance of this difference. (Figure 9) (Figure 10)
Richmond Hill has higher mean property prices than Jamaica Bay (Queens) and South Jamaica, and again, the p-values confirm the statistical significance of this difference.

There is no significant difference in the mean property prices between Richmond Hill and Ozone Park, as the p-value is above 0.05. However, there is a significant difference between Richmond Hill and Woodhaven, with Richmond Hill having lower average prices. (Figure 11)
Richmond Hill's mean property prices are significantly lower than those of Forest Hills and Kew Gardens, as indicated by the low p-values. (Figure 12) (Figure 13) (Figure 14)
These insights confirm the existence of two distinct neighborhood clusters consistent with previous analyses. They also show that Richmond Hill's property market is more affordable than other neighborhoods, which could attract more potential buyers and lead to more transactions and commissions. However, lower prices also mean lower commission amounts, and this is a trade-off a real estate brokerage may need to consider.

In conclusion, our analysis provides valuable insights into residential sale price differences. While Richmond Hill is a good location with a less volatile market and unique pricing, the lower property prices may result in smaller commission amounts.

## Analysis 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis (Predictive Analysis)
Analysis of the Time Series Data and Choice of Model (ETS & Moving Average)
The first part of our EDA involves examining the trend and seasonality of the time series data. Trend Analysis: An initial glance at the time series plot shows an overall upward trend in the neighborhood's total dollar amount of residential real estate sales from 2009 to the present. Although there are some fluctuations, the general trend indicates consistent growth over the years. For instance, in the first quarter of 2009, the total sales price was $31,238,662, which escalated to $81,627,544 by the first quarter of 2021. (Figure1)

#### Seasonality Analysis:
The data also exhibit some seasonality, with the fourth quarter often recording higher sales than other quarters. For example, in 2009, the fourth quarter registered the highest sales amounting to $52,555,693. While we do not observe this pattern consistently across all years, it's a trend that reoccurs in multiple instances. (Figure1)

#### Choice of Model:
We must consider the observed trend and seasonality to model this time series data effectively. The Moving Average model is a simple forecasting method that uses the average of the previous observations to predict future values. On the other hand, ETS is a more complex method that can account for trends and seasonality, making it a potentially good fit for our dataset. (Figure2) (Figure4) Upon evaluating the model parameters and residuals, we find that the ARIMA and SARIMA models—more sophisticated versions of the MA model—perform similarly, suggesting they are identical in this context. We expected this outcome since the SARIMA model defaults to an ARIMA model when there are no seasonal parameters, which is our case.

The ETS model, although showing a higher Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) implying a worse fit to the data compared to ARIMA and SARIMA models, presents lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The MAE, RMSE, and MAPE suggest that the ETS model may have slightly better forecasting accuracy. Additionally, the ETS model shows a lower standard deviation of residuals, which could indicate a better fit for the data. Considering these results, selecting a " best " model is challenging. If interpretability is of primary importance, we might lean towards the ARIMA or SARIMA models due to their simplicity and easier comprehension. However, we prefer the ETS model since forecasting accuracy takes precedence. The marginally lower MAE, RMSE, and MAPE contribute significantly to this context: accurately forecasting real estate prices in Richmond Hill. It's crucial to remember that these results are based on a single train-test split of the data. We suggest employing cross-validation to acquire a more robust comparison of the models.

### Predictive Analytics
#### ETS (MAN) – Model Summary and Interpretation
Our analysis used the ETS(MAN) model to forecast the total dollar amount of residential real estate sales in Richmond Hill. The model summary provided us with essential statistics to evaluate its performance. Lower AIC and BIC scores indicated a better fit of the model to our data. In the case of our ETS(MAN) model, the AIC was 1912.3661, and BIC was 1922.1223. The ME was nearly 0 (0.012755), indicating a minimal deviation between observed and predicted values. The RMSE was 0.223382, and the MAE was 0.17797, suggesting that the model's residuals were negligible. The MPE and MAPE were also almost 0, indicating that the model's percentage error was minimal. The ACF1 score was -0.0357191, suggesting a slight negative autocorrelation in the residuals. (Figure3) (Figure4) The ETS(MAN) model's forecast for the next eight quarters showed a steady increase in the total dollar amount of residential real estate sales in Richmond Hill. The forecasted sales values ranged from $82,922,911.52 in Q2 2022 to $87,706,054.43 in Q1 2024. (Figure5)

Although there were minor discrepancies between actual and forecasted sales values in some quarters, the standard deviation (7,242,444.81) between them is not substantial, considering the size of the predicted values. Additionally, with a z-score of 0.094347, the model's prediction for four forecasted quarters was very close to the average accuracy of the model's predictions, indicating its reliability and stability. The overlay plot shows that the model is performing well since the residuals are randomly distributed around zero, indicating that the model's predictions are, on average, accurate. (Figure6)

Overall, the ETS(MAN) model fit the data well and produced reliable forecasts for the next eight quarters. The forecasted sale prices suggest that Richmond Hill is a good neighborhood for a new real estate brokerage, given the model's low error rates and forecasts of steady growth in real estate sales. However, external factors not included in the model could influence real estate sales, and ongoing monitoring and analysis would be crucial to ensure the forecast remains accurate.

Multiple Regression – Model Summary and Interpretation
The multiple regression model provides a comprehensive approach to forecasting the next eight quarters of sales by considering Time and seasonality as variables.

#### Model Summary:
The AIC and BIC values are 1854.489523 and 1866.196985, respectively, suggesting a reasonable fit. The adjusted R-squared value is 0.644533779, which indicates that approximately 64.45% of the variation in residential real estate sales can be explained by the model's input variables (Time and seasonality). The F-Statistic is 24.11838701, suggesting a statistically significant relationship between the variables and the sales. (Figure8) Forecasted Sales: The forecasted sales for the next eight quarters show trend and seasonality. The trend is increasing over Time, and the fluctuations between quarters reflect the seasonality. For instance, the Q2 (April-June) and Q4 (October-December) quarters of both 2022 and 2023 have forecasted sales higher than their preceding quarters. (Figure9)

#### P-values:
The P-values for the coefficients help determine the significance of each variable in the model. Here, the P-value for Time is less than 0.05 (1.98172E-12), suggesting that Time is a significant variable in predicting sales. However, the P-values for the seasonal variables (Q1, Q2, Q3) are all above 0.05, indicating that they are not statistically significant predictors within this model. In other words, according to this model, changes in quarters do not significantly impact sales. Overall, the model is statistically significant with a very low P-value of 0.0000000000651. (Figure7) The multiple regression model predicts a rise in residential real estate sales in Richmond Hill for the next eight quarters. This analysis can be valuable for those considering opening a new real estate brokerage in the area. However, it's essential to acknowledge that the model has its limitations. Although the model indicates that seasonal changes don't significantly impact sales, business experience may suggest otherwise. Furthermore, while the model has a good fit (with an adjusted R-squared of approximately 0.64), around 35% of sales variation remains unexplained. The unexplained 35% could be because of other factors not accounted for in the model, such as macroeconomic variables, local market conditions, or unexpected events. Considering these factors and refining the model or using a complementary method to improve the forecast would be beneficial.

#### Multiple Regression – Variable Analysis
The multiple regression model output – modeled on Sale Date, Year Built, Building Type, Gross Square Feet, and Number of Units – provides insights into predicting the sale amount for a property in Richmond Hill. The model has an adjusted R-squared of 0.68997, which indicates that about 69% of the variability in the sale price can be explained by the predictors used in the model. The AIC and BIC values of 131114.0415 and 131250.3321 indicate a good fit, respectively. (Figure10) The most useful predictors are those with a p-value less than 0.05. Sale Date, Year Built, Gross Square Feet, and Units all have p-values less than 0.05, making them statistically significant predictors. Some levels of Building Code also have significant p-values and contribute to the model's predictability. (Figure11) Some Building Code levels, such as A2, A3, B1, B9, C5, and D1, have p-values over 0.05, meaning they do not significantly contribute to the model. We can view them as redundant variables. We can further analyze the Building Code level description to determine if there is a pattern to codes with high P-values versus low P-values.

To sum up, the information gathered can aid in making informed decisions regarding a new real estate agency in Richmond Hill. Using the model's forecasts can help pinpoint market inefficiencies, leading to better advice for clients on what factors influence market value. It's essential to remember that the model does not account for other market and location-related factors, which may be crucial to understanding Richmond Hill's real estate landscape.

#### Multiple Regression Analysis – Residual Analysis
The residuals show the difference between the observed and predicted sale prices, allowing us to identify both bargains and overpriced properties. Bargains are properties with large negative residuals, meaning they were sold for less than what the model predicted. These include properties like "86-21 112TH STREET", with a residual of approximately -2,534,924.99, and "116-05 JAMAICA AVENUE", with a residual of about -1,098,706.37. On the other hand, overpriced properties are those with large positive residuals, signifying they were sold for more than the model's prediction. Notable overpriced properties are "118-22 ATLANTIC AVENUE", with a residual of about 2,881,914.22, and "87-14 129TH STREET", with a residual of around 1,942,841.85. (Figure12)

The discrepancies between the model's predictions and actual sale prices can arise due to numerous factors. The model, although robust, may not account for all the variables influencing the sale prices, such as specific property features, the urgency of the sale, and the negotiation skills of the buyer and seller. Additionally, market conditions at the time of sale, which can fluctuate widely, are another critical element the model may not fully capture. If we omitted important factors from the model, then the residuals may reflect the influence of these omitted variables rather than "bargains" or "overpricing."

These insights can greatly benefit creating a new real estate brokerage in Richmond Hill. Identifying properties that are either overpriced or a good deal can guide the brokerage's investment choices and provide buying insights to clients. Nevertheless, it's crucial to remember that these predictions should be combined with thoroughly comprehending the local market and other specific property factors not considered in the model.

## Analysis 5 - Executive Summary (Prescriptive Analysis)
Our business case has systematically progressed through descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. We began with a comprehensive understanding of our historical data, where we identified key trends and patterns. We then diagnosed the causes of these patterns and used this understanding to predict future outcomes. Our cluster analysis, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling consistently identified Richmond Hill as a unique opportunity due to its stable, low-price points compared to other neighborhoods.

In this prescriptive step, we developed an optimization model to guide our strategic decision to open a new brokerage in Richmond Hill. Our model optimized three key decision variables - commission rate, number of employees, and office size - and maximized our profit's NPV over eight quarters from 2022 Q1 to 2023 Q4. The model's results suggest a strategic roadmap for our new brokerage. We should maintain a commission rate of around 0.045 to attract a larger market share. The number of employees should remain constant at 1, which is sufficient to handle the market activity in Richmond Hill. The office size should stay constant at the minimum required size of 375 square feet to minimize rent and utility costs. With these recommendations, we expect to generate a total discounted profit of $1,443,088.49 and 6.75% market penetration over eight quarters.

In conclusion, prescriptive analytics has provided valuable insights to guide our decision-making, optimize our operations and achieve our financial goals. However, it's important to note that these recommendations rely on the current market conditions and our understanding of our variables. As with any model, monitoring performance and updating as necessary to reflect changing market conditions and new data is crucial. This ongoing commitment to data-driven decision-making will be vital to our sustained success in the Richmond Hill real estate market.
